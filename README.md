# Solving The Salesman Problem (i.e., TSP) using the Genetic Algorithm

The salesman problem is a problem in which, given nodes representing destinations and edges representing the distance between the nodes, 
one should find the shortest path in which all nodes have been traveled. The 'TSP_using_Genetic_Algorithm.ipynb' is a Python implementation of the Genetic Algorithm to solve the salesman problem for 6 different cities. Namely, New York, Cincinnati, Denver and etc. A detailed description of the assignment can be viewed via the pdf file and the final report of our study is detailed in the 'Project1_Team 4.docx' file.
