# Solving The Salesman Problem (i.e., TSP) using the Genetic Algorithm

The salesman problem is a problem in which, given nodes that represents destinations and edges that represents the distance between the nodes, 
one should find the shortest path in which all nodes have been traveled. The solving_TSP_using_Genetic_Algorithm.ipynb is a python implementation of the Genetic Algorithm to solve the salesman problem for 6 different cities. Namely, New York, Cincinatti, Denver and etc. Detailed description of the assignment can be viewed via the pdf file and the final report of our study is detailed in 'Project1_Team 4.docx' file.
